Agriculture Data Visualization

Description
---
<p> This is a visualization for Record Keeping for Farmers using Adobe Illustrator. The folder contains two designs.</p>

### Design 1: Radial Assets Visualization:

<p>This visualization is inspired by Nadieh Bremer’s vis called “Threat” [1]. It is for visualizing the farm's assets.
The main structure of the vis is a network. The graph consists of pie charts of the farm's areas connected to circles in the middle representing the asset types. 
The asset types are connected to a group of circles in the last arc, representing a detailed asset list.
We categorize the asset type circles by color. Every pie chart is colored with all of the asset types' colors that are connected to. The circles are encoded by size.
The plan for this is to make it interactive. When the viewer hovers over each circle, it shows all of its connections. For example, if we hover over a pie chart, 
 the area's name appears in the first arc along with connections to the asset types contained in that farm's area. Each of these types has a connection to the last upper arc,
  where it presents the details of that asset.</p>
  
  ### Design 2: Radial Planting Timeline:
  
  <p> This visualization is a radial planting timeline. Each line represents the planting time of a specific plant. 
  Where the yellow part represents the growth period, and the green part represents the harvest period. The plan is to make this visualization interactive;
  so that when the viewer hovers over a plant line, a tooltip in the middle circle shows up. 
  The tooltip presents details about that planting process, such as the plant name, farmer's name, seed/transplant date, and harvest date.</p>
